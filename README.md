## Mantel Group technical assessment


The aim of the following task is to create a dataset from a collection of JSON files which contain hourly weather data for a number of cities in Australia over a period of 24 hours. The Weather_task.ipynb code in this respitory complete the following tasks:

1. Reads the data contained within the JSON files and creates a Pandas dataframe.
2. Transforms and loads the data to produce the following two outputs containing:
a. The average temperature for each city.
b. The top three most common “weather text” for each city.
3. Save the two results you produce in CSV format.

## Requirements

This project is coded in a Google Colab Juypter notebook which uses Python 3.6, and so this guide assumes you are using the same. The project's dependencies are listed below:
* numpy
* pandas
* json
* google.colab
* glob
* os
* collections

## Running the program

Clone the github respitory to your google drive using the code below.

!git clone https://github.com/kateh321/Mathproject

The files are now saved on your google drive ready to be used, go to https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive and a new folder Mathproject should be present with the programs in it.
